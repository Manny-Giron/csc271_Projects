    <h1>Ty Mitchell</h1>
    <p>Ty Mitchell is a junior at the <strong>University of Rhode Island</strong> majoring in computer science.
        He’s especially interested in both the hardware and software sides of technology,
        which inspired him to build his own computer during the pandemic, a challenging
        but rewarding experience that deepened his understanding of PC components.
        Since then, he has continued upgrading and refining his system.
        Ty’s favorite website is YouTube because of its wide variety of content and easy-to-use interface,
        which often helps him explore new interests. His curiosity and hands-on approach reflect his passion
        for learning and creating with technology.
