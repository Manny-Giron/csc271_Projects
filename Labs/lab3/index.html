        <h3>Why I love burritos</h3>
        <pre>   The burrito is debatebly my most favorite dish for a few reasons. Firstly, I find it delicious.
After that, I like how customizable it is. You can add or remove ingredients to fit your taste.
And, its a dish that has pretty much everything you need in one meal. It has carbs, protein, and vegetables.
It is quite filling, sometimes <em>too</em> filling.

    Interestingly, the name <em>Burrito</em> actually means "little donkey" in Spanish due to the belief that the 
food resembles a donkey's pack

        <h3>What makes a burrito?</h3>
        <pre>
    The burrito is fundamentally comprised of a soft flour tortilla that wraps around a variety of fillings. 
At its core, a burrito is defined by its portability and the way its ingredients are enclosed, making it easy to eat on the go. 
While the specific fillings can vary widely, the essential characteristic is the combination of ingredients all wrapped together, 
creating a balanced and satisfying meal in a single package.
